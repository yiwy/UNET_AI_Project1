# UNET_AI_Project1
# This project was complied as part of Artificial Intelligence assignment
# The aim of the project was to get student familiar with AI concepts and "hands on" programmig using Python, Pytorch and Lightning. 
# The project contains a main body program "Main.py" with a menu with seven options, these are:
# [1] Option 1: Run a Basic Neural Network using Pytorch. "Predetermine Weights and Bias will be printed along with chart"
# [2] Option 2: Run, a Pytorch, Trained Neural Network with Bias bfinal = 0
# [3] Option 3: Optimised the Neural Network using SGD
# [4] Option 4: Run Basic Neural Network Using Pytorch and Lightning. Predetermine Weights and Bias will be printed along with chart
# [5] Option 5: Run, a Pytorch and Lightning, Trained Neural Network with Bias bfinal = 0
# [6] Option 6: Optimised the Neural Network Using Pytorch and Lightning")
# [7] Option 7: Create an LSTM model, prints out the Weights and Bias, and compare the observed and predicted values for Company A and B.
# [8] Option 8: Train the LTSM unit using Lightning and TesorBaord with epoch=2000/3000/5000"
# [9] Option 9: Using and optimizing the PyTorch LSTM, nnLSTM()
# [0] Exit the program

# To run program, packages NNEx1, NNEx2, and NNex3 need to be availalbe as menu option 1 to 3 call modules from NNEx1 - U, 4 to 6 calls modules from NNEx2, and option 7 to 9 call modules from NNex3. Each module, on each package, contains additional comments related to specific module function. 
# Finally, based programs have been taked from https://www.youtube.com/user/joshstarmer .
